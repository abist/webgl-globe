The **WebGL Globe** is an open platform for geographic data visualization created by the Google Data Arts Team. We encourage you to copy the code, add your own data, and create your own globes.

Check out the examples at http://www.chromeexperiments.com/globe, and if you create a globe, please [share it with us](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/submit). We post our favorite globes publicly.
